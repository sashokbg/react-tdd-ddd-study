# Studying Domain and Test Driven Design Principles in Frontend Applications

This repository showcases how some DDD and TDD principles can be used in a classic React application with the help of a reactive framework called "Signals".

Please note that this is not a showcase for the technical aspects of how Signals work, but rather an example of how frontend business logic can be developed using TDD and DDD.

Please read the related article on my blog for more information.
